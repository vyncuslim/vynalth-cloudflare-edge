# Vynalth Cloudflare Edge

Unified Cloudflare edge Worker for Vynalth-managed web properties.

## Managed zones

The Worker is configured for the apex and all HTTP/HTTPS subdomains of:

- `vynalthai.com`
- `vyncuslim.com`
- `sleepsomno.com`
- `powiismunc.com`
- `vitamindai.online`

Mail transport hostnames that are used for SMTP/IMAP/POP should remain DNS-only and are not expected to use HTTP response headers.

## Architecture

```text
Browser / API client
  -> Cloudflare edge
     -> DDoS protection
     -> WAF / custom rules
     -> bot and rate-limit controls
     -> zone security policy
  -> Vynalth Cloudflare Edge Worker
     -> preserves the original public hostname / Host header
     -> adds x-vynalth-* tracing headers
  -> the hostname's configured Cloudflare DNS origin
  -> application origin (Vercel or another backend)
```

The Worker does not hard-code a single Vercel hostname. Each domain and subdomain keeps its own DNS origin, so multiple sites can safely share the same edge Worker.

## Response tracing headers

HTTP/HTTPS responses traversing the Worker receive:

```text
x-vynalth-edge: cloudflare-worker
x-vynalth-edge-host: <public hostname>
x-vynalth-zone: <root zone>
x-vynalth-request-id: <unique UUID>
x-vynalth-ray-id: <Cloudflare Ray ID when available>
x-vynalth-origin: vercel | fastly | dns-origin
```

`x-vynalth-request-id` is generated at the edge for every request.

## Canonical redirect

Only `www.vynalthai.com` is canonicalized by this Worker:

```text
https://www.vynalthai.com/*
  -> 301
https://vynalthai.com/*
```

Certificate and Vercel ownership validation paths are exempt from this redirect:

```text
/.well-known/acme-challenge/*
/.well-known/vercel/*
```

## Worker routes

`wrangler.toml` attaches this Worker to both the apex and wildcard route for every managed zone:

```text
vynalthai.com/*
*.vynalthai.com/*

vyncuslim.com/*
*.vyncuslim.com/*

sleepsomno.com/*
*.sleepsomno.com/*

powiismunc.com/*
*.powiismunc.com/*

vitamindai.online/*
*.vitamindai.online/*
```

A hostname must still have a valid Cloudflare DNS record and its HTTP/HTTPS traffic must actually enter Cloudflare for the Worker route to execute.

## vynalthai.com partial DNS setup

`vynalthai.com` currently uses a Cloudflare Partial/CNAME setup with Dynadot remaining authoritative.

External authoritative DNS should send proxied web hostnames to Cloudflare's partial hostname. Examples:

```text
@            ANAME -> vynalthai.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
www          CNAME -> www.vynalthai.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
partner      CNAME -> partner.vynalthai.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
status       CNAME -> status.vynalthai.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
```

Inside the Cloudflare zone, each hostname keeps its real application origin, for example a Vercel CNAME.

Do not point public authoritative DNS directly at Vercel if the hostname is intended to traverse Vynalth Edge.

## Other managed zones

For zones using Cloudflare as authoritative DNS, web-facing A/AAAA/CNAME records should normally be proxied (orange cloud) when they are intended to use Vynalth Edge.

Do not proxy ordinary mail transport records such as MX targets used for SMTP/IMAP/POP.

- `wrangler.toml` — Worker configuration and multi-zone routes.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — GitHub Actions deployment workflow.

## GitHub repository secrets

Automatic deployment requires:

```text
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
```

The Cloudflare API token must be allowed to deploy Workers and manage Worker routes for all managed zones.

## Verification

Examples:

```powershell
curl.exe -I https://vynalthai.com
curl.exe -I https://vyncuslim.com
curl.exe -I https://sleepsomno.com
curl.exe -I https://powiismunc.com
curl.exe -I https://vitamindai.online
curl.exe -I https://partner.vynalthai.com
```

Expected Cloudflare/Vynalth indicators include:

```text

x-vynalth-edge-host: ...
x-vynalth-zone: ...
x-vynalth-request-id: ...
x-vynalth-ray-id: ...
x-vynalth-origin: ...
```

## Local commands

```bash
